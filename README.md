<img src="https://github.com/fulford/VaPorPackage/raw/master/docs/images/logo.png" width="200">

This is the package that contains all classes needed to run simulations with VaPor.

For a batteries-included experience, this repo also contains some data needed to run VaPor simulations.

To use VaPor you must place the `+VaPor` package in a location that on your MATLAB path.

Each of VaPor's classes are then exposed as `VaPor.x`.
